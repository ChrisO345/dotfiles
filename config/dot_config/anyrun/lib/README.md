# anyrun lib files

This folder is intended to hold library files (*.so) required by the anyrun tool.

These binaries are **not committed** to this repository because:

- They are platform-specific.
- They are binary files that can be rebuilt or obtained separately.

## How to obtain these files

- Instructions to build the libraries from source are available in the [anyrun repository](https://github.com/anyrun-org/anyrun)  
- Alternatively, download prebuilt `.so` files if available there.

Please ensure that the `.so` files are placed in this folder before running anyrun.
