# example.conf - Key-Value Mappings
#
# This is an example file used to define key-value mappings for use in Eww scripts.
# It allows shell scripts to map between human-friendly names and system-specific identifiers.
#
# Format:
#   Key = Value
#
# - Keys should be human-readable names.
# - Values can be system IDs, commands, paths, etc.
# - Lines starting with '#' are ignored.
#
# Example:
WebcamMic=webcam-device-id
InternalMic=internal-mic-id
