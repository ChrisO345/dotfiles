## TODO

1. Make a script to clone and install the sddm theme.
2. Add flags for different modules (mason, pillar, etc.)
3. Add consistent logging methods between script files.
4. Have a way to clone nvim repo and put into `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim`. I don't want this to be copied so maybe a symlink or simply an install and populate script? Will need a way to prevent overwriting though.
